Twitter Clone
=============

I cloned the [Twitter](http://twitter.com) website to practice my Rails and BackboneJS skills.
I first wrote a simple MVP in Rails and then transferred it over to BackboneJS. I then started
adding features straight to BackboneJS. However, a lot of the app is still functional via Rails.

My app allows users to sign up and sign in. Users can also do both through [Facebook](http://facebook.com).
